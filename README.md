# Task Manager CLI with GoLang and SQLite ðŸ“Ÿ

The Task Manager CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built with GoLang. Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks, all of which are stored in a SQLite database.

- List Tasks: View all tasks with details.
- Update Task: Modify existing tasks.
- Delete Task: Remove a task from the list.
- Mark as Done: Mark a task as completed.
- Search Tasks: Search tasks by keyword.

## Directory Structure

- `cmd/`: Contains Go files for different commands (add, list, update, etc.).
- `db/`: Manages database connection and migrations.
- `models/`: Defines the Task model and related database operations.
- `main.go`: The entry point of the application.
